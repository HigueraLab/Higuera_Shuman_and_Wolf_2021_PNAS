## Data, code, and figures from "Rocky Mountain subalpine forests now burning more than any time in recent millennia"

## Overview

This archive includes data and scripts needed to reproduce the analyses in Higuera, Shuman, and Wolf (2021). After extracting the .zip archive, there are three directories: code, data, and figures. Contents in each directory are describe in detail below.
